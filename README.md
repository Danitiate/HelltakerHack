# HelltakerHack
A maze solver for solving all the puzzles in the game Helltaker. Also a level creator if you wanted to play more of this amazing game

## Background
It was the fall of 2020 and I was playing this game called [Helltaker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1289310/Helltaker/). I was stuck on this puzzle and was challenged by my friend to create an algorithm that could solve the puzzle for me. I accepted the challenge and ended up with this over-engineered solution.

### Game Mechanics
- There is a grid where the player can move up, down, left, right
- If there is an obstacle on the square the player wants to move to, the object gets pushed back. Player stays on the same square
- The player wins if they reach a square next to the goal
- The player has a limited amount of moves to get to the goal


## Usage

```
# Run program
dotnet run --project HelltakerHack
```
